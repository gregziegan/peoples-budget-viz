# Generation ideas

#1 Roads first, uniform after:
Wave function collapse for roads
Fill in empty slots with Random.gaussian [ Hospital, Park, etc ] (<| build the list from the budget)

pros:
  dead simple

cons:
  lower budget should mean worse or less roads (or more in terms of highway vs train?)


The game init, a set of roads is generated by the wave function. Then, the initial budget is considered, and a random distribution of buildings and parks fill in empty space.

On game update, do a random but weighted budget selection to replace buildings lost from the budget.

For trains/busses/traffic density: "overlay approach"
  We generate these _atop_ the road tiles, considering only the budget and unique constraints to the train, bus, traffic density like: must be at least 3 tiles long and connected
  

#2 Everything at once (more ambitious?):

Wave function collapse considers the initial budget (weight the greed of the algorithm by budget?)

Cyril: go back and mark the spots that would be impacted by changed budget?

pros:
  can entirely generate the map with the same algorithm - code simplicity
  can account for road and budget issues, trains, etc

cons:
  possibly more complex in initial implementation, dense code
